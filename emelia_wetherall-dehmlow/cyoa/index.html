<h1>This is a forest, well for now it is a forest. Many people now are taking down trees. After taking down the trees all that will be left is a body of water, and this wont be the same either. It might flood because there will less animals to drink from it, it might dry out from the sun, or it may remain a body of water. Although we will never look at it the same way, in ours eyes in may become a lake,a puddle or just a meaningless essence. All the more reason to stop deforestation.</h1>
<h1>Sunsets</h1>

<h1>Have you ever seen a sunset? Of course you have they happen each night before we go to bed. sometimes we catch one when they are at their finest, but often times we dont find ourselves outside in order to see this wonder. Instead of seeing one in person we look at pictures others took.</h1>
<h1>Northern lights</h1>

<h1>Have you ever seen northern lights? Maybe you haven't seen them in person, but certainly you must have heard of them. They're very mysterious and many people wonder how this phenominon began. They can only be seen in certain locations.</h1>
<h1>Redbud Tree

<h1>Lemons are one of my favorite fruits. Unless you want your mouth to explode, you probably shouldn't eat one by itself. They are the best in Lemonade, a popular beverage that is sold most in summer time.</h1>
<h1>Rabits</h1>

<h1>There is a lot more nature around us we just need to get off our electronic devices and look at it. Many people miss various things because they are not in touch with reality. Of course electronic devices are not terrible. Infact they are incredibly useful in our current inovations, but it is all about balance. If there is the right amount of balance between the two then you will be able to observe nature, while going further with inovations,research,passions and whatever else we use technology for. Step away from whatever you are doing right now,look out the window, find something that seems interestingand focus in on that, then go back to that thing you were doing and see how calm you feel.</h1>
