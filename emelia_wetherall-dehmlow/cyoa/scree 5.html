    <p> You climb higher in the tree and rest your head against the trunk, hiding from the helcopter,buying yourself time to ponder that thought that hit you. It wasnt a thought though,it was a memory, something from your past life that you couldnt place, you remember nothing from your past life. You were only three feet tall then. He loomed over you staring at you as if you had just done the worst thing, an unimaginable, a terror. And you had, Broken your mothers glass bowl the only thing she had left of her own mother. And not by accident, it was your own fault, you were angry ather for sending you to your room. And it came to you. The madness? the insane. The part of you, you never wished to see. The side you had created out of lies. The man was your father and he was mad. His facewas red and his eyes were bulging out atyou, a vein in his face poping in and out as the blood pumped. You could tell he was nervous about what he was about to do. He picked you up in his arms and carried you outside. He told you to go and to find a new home. At the time it made sense. You had done something terrible and this was your punishment. Later in your life you began to think on this and it made less sence. Nowyou understand why. He was mad, insane. He was feeding off your own fear for to long, raising his standards for you until he broke, because you could never live up to these. He wasnt gone. He was the one, out of sheer regret, who put you on the rope, and now he washeaded towards you. You looked aheadthe sun was rising, and so you leapt. From one stiff branch to another, and steadily you were safe. You grew tiredbut kept going until you cameupon a village. therewere people like you and mysteries yet to be solved. </p>
