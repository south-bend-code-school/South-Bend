<p>You scape the land desperately. You try building a stick fort buteach time you think you are almost done the whole thing collaspes. You know that if you dont do something you wont last the entire night. You soon wander far from where you first were. You keep wandering until your legs tire. Your head spins faster in the waves of the beating sun. You feel your strength leave you and you toppleto the ground. You wakeup to see trees around you. You know that you are not where you started.Suddenly a face appears in front of you. "are you alright?" asks a little girl. Her hair is parted into two braids and she is wearing rags. "are you alright?" You ask. She looks at you. "Why wouldn't I be alright" she replied. You stand up and face her. She runs off into the forest. What will you do?</p>
