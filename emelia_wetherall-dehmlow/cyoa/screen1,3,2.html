  <p> You wander across the vast field now. Trying to find a safe place to go. You feel confident, strong and hopeful now that you have survived the day, but you cant help wanting more out of life than an exhilerating adventure. You step in hole. Your balance leaves you and you feel yourself loosing the balance beneath you. You hit your head vilently on the sharp grass. You spot a bird above you holding a piece of cactus. It drops the spiky mess onto your face and your vision leaves you. Suddnely you hear a voice, small but beautiful. You have heard no voices other than your own in days. "do you need help?" says the voice. You cant speak so you throw your hands in the air and you try to place where its coming from. "Can you see?" It asks loudly. Teras stream down your blind eyes, they found you. You feel a hand tap your shoulder and you reachout for it.You grab it and climb up a helicopter ladder. You are saved. </p>
