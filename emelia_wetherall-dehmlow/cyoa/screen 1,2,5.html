<p> You scrape the tough bark with your hands. Sap digging its way under your finger nails. You soon pull yourself onto a branch, just below the canopy of the tree. Each tree has a large circular canopy with surounding branches under it. It is cold and the leopards still leark below you. Watcing your every move. Waiting to snap their jaw against you. Trying to make it through the night you keep your eyes open until sweet sleep falls upon you. "crash" you hear a sudden noise from the edge of the forest. It starts off small and become much louder as whatever it is come closer to you. "crash!", "Bang!", "pitterpatter" the sound become clearer, they are coming to get you, whoever they are. straners only interested in obtaining money, family if any of them are left, the very people who started this, the ones that left you there on the rope. "who were they?" you canteven remember enough to place where you were when the incident began. Then it hits you. Do you? </p>
