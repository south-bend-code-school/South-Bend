<p>The cliff is slanted. You feel as if you are climbing across a ceiling. The gash in your side is numb now. A slight breeze comes by you. You forgot what warm breezes felt like. When you reach the top, you look out to a large field of grass. Your legs fail and you fall head first into what feels like a cloud of dandelions. What was at first a terrible situation became a glorious wonder. You space off from the fact that you are stranded and you are alone, and you have no way to get back to your home, but you don't even remember what home was like. Suddenly reality hits you. You realize that you need to find a safe place to stay before nightfall. Do you?</p>
