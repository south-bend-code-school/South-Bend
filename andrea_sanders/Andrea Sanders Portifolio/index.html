             <h1> Hi, I'm Andrea</h1>
             <p> I am currently a college student that attends to Indiana University South Bend.
             I wasn't so sure on what major I should get into but I became interested in web development.
             I was born and raised in South Bend, Indiana. I love to shop, bake, socialize with other people, and just enjoy life.
             </p>
             <p>I have faith in God. I truly believe that there is a battle between good and evil spiritually in this world.
             I sometimes attend church and currently working on having a better relationship with God.
           I know that God has a Divine plan for me and there is purpose on why I'm here on this planet.
            I just have to keep my faith, let God take control of my life and just put my trust in Him. </p>

            <p>I'm going to be doing blogs about anything.
              I can talk about relationships, school, money, and mostly importantly the Bible.</p>
