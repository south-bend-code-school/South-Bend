    <p>You jump onto the lifeboat safely and drift off to sea far away from the mysterious island. You missed out on all of the adventures you could've had if only you would've stayed on the mysterious island. You find yourself difting for hours and hours. You think you might be going somewhere but your not. You wash up againt the cliff to see the same rope still hanging. You begin to climb up until you find the perfect place to swing onto the rock it pierces your side. You climb up the cliff clenching your side in your hand.</p>
