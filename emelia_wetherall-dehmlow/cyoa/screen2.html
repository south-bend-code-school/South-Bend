  <p>You're 20 feet down when you stumble upon a ledge. You stop to catch your breath, but you can't get enough air. You realize that from climbing the wound has deppened into your lungs. You scramble around frightened, not knowing what the future has in store for you. You reach for your head band and break the seem. You pull off your jacket and tie it tightly aroung the wound. You can feel tears flooding your eyes. You question yourself again, trying to pull yourself closer to the stumbling mystery that brought you to this place in time. Your hands are covered in cold dry blood. The wound stopped bleeding, but the excrutiating pain continues. You try to calm your small breaths, and look around to consider your options. You spot a cave at the bottom of the cliff, you see a the rope still hanging, and you see a life boat dloating gently in the water. What do you do?</p>
