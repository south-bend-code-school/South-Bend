<p> you sprint towards the girl as fast as you can, still she is faster. You feel your speed increase as you lunge forward. You are going faster than ever and still you cannot catch up to her. She is small, and her hair flows elegantly behind her. She looks as if she is running at lightning speeds. Finally you are about to catch up to her pace, but stumbleand find youself running through what feels like another demension. You are in your closet now. Was it your imagination acting up again? Was it a dream that you had fallen into? or was it something else? A mystery you will never solve. </p>
