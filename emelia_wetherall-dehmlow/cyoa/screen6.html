<p>Hope, bright hope fill your eyes as the helicopter comes closer to you. You are saved. Hot tears fill your sorrowfull eyes, tired with regret. A strangers hand reaches out to you, it pull you in and you comeface to face with the drive and the though you had pushed away hits you harder than any thought. You were faceto face with your nightmare, the very person that had left you there on the rope hoping he could leave there to die. He was tall and bald. He wore a hat to cover his worst insecurity, We all have them,sometimes these are the things that compell us to do things we shouldnt. You stare at him, and he stares at you with a vile smirk acroos his face. You cant move. Frozen. </p>
