<p>You are hanging from a rope. 60 feet off the ground, while swinging side to side. You don't know how you got there or why you found yourself hanging with such a tight grip. All you know is that the rope is fraying, and if you dont do something fast you will die. You look down to the cold unforginving ocean, and then up to the blaring sun above you. Your skin is burnt and your hands are sore. The question passes you mind again. "why am I here?" You find yourself stressing over the fact that you can't answer that question and you may never be able to answer it. What would you say when people ask about your crazy adventure? Would you tell them that you fell asleep during a flight,and then what, found yourself hanging off a rope. Surely they would call you crazy. You would be known as the elder whomakes up stories to entertain people. You would be the storyteller. Even though your dream was to become a doctor the thought of someday becoming a storyteller did not upset you. Your grip tightens when you feel the rope shift down a notch. Only 50 feet left until you plunged to your death. Frantically you swing onto the cliff side from which you were hanging. You feel a sharp pain and suddenly you spot a splotch of blood. You look down to see that your side has been pierced by a sharp rock. You clench the wound tightly. You need to go somewhere. Do you?
