  <p>You try to pull yourself up, gathering all your strength together you tug on the branch. You cannot climb any farther, but you cannot fall, not now you are to close to just give up. Why? why do you hang there idl? Why do you not have enough strength within. Is it strength? or is it hope? indeed maybe you will reach your destiny but no hope you have, peaceyou have lost by hanging there, not the type of peace through which everything is quiet, the everything is right content for once. The typeof peace thatcan only be obtained through hope. The type of peace that not many can reach, and you are reaching for it, but falling behind it sorely. And you fell, hard against the ground. Realityleave you as you feel yourself, falling and falling and falling, and failing on your way down, into a pool of light.</p>
