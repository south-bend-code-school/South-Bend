<p>You run fast, but not fast enough. You feel your hard breath trail behind you, it is cold. You sigh and you find yourself running faster than you've ever run before. You feel your balance leave from beneath youand you fall. Aiming your gaze towards the sky finally you collaps pulling your hands in toward your chest. Your head crashes against the sharp grass. With cuts all against your face you try to pull yourself up again in order to not be eaten by the leopards, but you feel your arm leave you, you crawl steadily with the limbs you have left into the bright light before you.</p>
