  <h4>Description</h4>
    <h5><p>Adams High School opened on September 30th, 1940. The school auditorium was once the only large performing stage in South Bend.

  <h4>FaQ</h4>
    <h5><p>What is the mission and profile of an IB student?</h5>

<p> The International Baccalaureate program aims to develop inquiring, knowledgeable and
caring young people who help to create a better and more peaceful world through
intercultural understanding and respect.</p>

 The program encourages students across the world to become active, compassionate,
and lifelong learners who understand that other people, with their differences, can also
be right.</p>

<h5><p>How does the IB Program work at JAHS?</p></h5>

<p> Students accepted into the Magnet program take Honors and Honors Advanced courses
in English, Math, Science and History in 9th and 10th grade.</p>
<p> In 11th and 12th grade, students take IB courses across a range of subjects.</p>
<p> Upon completion of each IB course, students take an exam which is assessed by
international IB examiners.</p>
<p> Scores are awarded for each course ranging from 1 (lowest) to 7 (highest)</p>
<p> Diploma is awarded to students who earn at least 24 points (out of maximum 45 points)</p>
<p> Students may elect not to pursue the full Diploma; these students take IB courses and IB
exams, earning the IB Certificate instead of the IB Diploma. </p>

<h5><p>What is the difference between IB and AP courses? </p></h5>

<p> Both IB and AP courses are college-prep classes through which students can earn
college credit, depending on the policies of the specific college a student attends.</p>
<p> IB courses emphasize critical thinking, writing, and problem-solving skills while AP
courses emphasize learning specific information to pass the AP exam.</p>
<p> IB provides a well-rounded curriculum, requiring advanced work across a range of
subjects. In contrast, AP is a course-by-course program, with students selecting
individual subjects in which to pursue advanced work.</p>
<p> IB is an internationally recognized curriculum allowing students to attend IB schools in
other countries if they participate in a high school foreign exchange program. IB also
facilitates application to international universities.</p>

<h5><p>What subjects do IB students take?</p></h5>

<p> Students take at least one course from each of 6 subject matter areas (note, in place
of Group 6, students can add an additional course from Group 1-5):</p>
<p>o Group 1 –English (literature)</p>
<p>o Group 2 –foreign languages: Spanish, French</p>
<p>o Group 3 - history, philosophy, geography, social and cultural anthropology
Group 4 - biology, chemistry, physics, environmental systems & societies</p>
<p>o Group 5 - mathematical studies, mathematics standard and higher level</p>
<p>o Group 6 - music, visual arts</p>

<h5><p>How much homework do IB students have?</p></h5>

<p> Generally, IB courses will require more work than other courses. IB Diploma candidates
also complete the Extended Essay, the Theory of Knowledge course, and other
requirements. As a result of the demands of the program, IB students at JAHS develop
effective time-management skills and participate fully in sports and other extracurricular
activities.</p>

<h5><p>What support is available for IB students (tutoring, study tables, other)?</p></h5>

<p> All students at Adams have access to Study Tables in the Library hosted by several
teachers daily from 3-4 pm on different subjects.</p>
<p> Tutoring is available, and can include senior students, university students, and teachers
who are willing to help.</p>
