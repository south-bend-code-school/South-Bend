<p>You walk through the field of grass and into a small patch of trees. Most of them are thin, but eventually you find one that works perfectly. Its thick and sturdy. Its branches are long and before night fall you find the perfect place to rest your eyes. You feel your eyes shutgently and you drift off to sleep. In the middle of the night you wake up to a rapid scratching. Its coming from the bottom of the tree. So startled you feel yourself loose your grip. Your fingers are now the only thing remaining on the branch. You look down to see a giant leopard circling around you. "what do you want?!?!" You scream. You think you've gone mad. It stops and stares at you for a second. It tilts its head and begins circling you again. You feel your fingers letting up, do you?</p>
